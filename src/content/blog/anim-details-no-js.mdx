While working on this site, I wound up using the HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` 
tags. They're quite neat if you're trying to go by with as little client-side JS 
as possible, but the only downside is that they don't support transitions out of 
the box, or atleast it seems complicated.

A simple search brought up the humble MDN page:

<LinkPreview 
  title="::details-content - CSS | MDN"
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/::details-content"
/>

which demonstrates adding a smooth fade-in/out animations on the details content 
using the `::details-content` pseudo selector (baseline 2025). This was very neat 
and can be applied by simply following the guide they gave. It looked good and is 
something I did end up using in the final version.

I wanted to implement a height-based transition as well. We know that animating 
height is always a pain due to the inability to animate from `height: 0` to 
`height: auto`, however, this time around I stumbled upon this excellent article:

<LinkPreview 
  title="CSS trick: Transition from height:0 to auto!"
  href="https://dev.to/francescovetere/css-trick-transition-from-height-0-to-auto-21de"
/>

But the technique discussed there by setting `display: grid` and animating the 
`grid-template-rows` didn't seem to work here (possible skill issue). Finally, I found
this article:

<LinkPreview 
  title="Animate to height: auto; (and other intrinsic sizing keywords) in CSS  |  CSS and UI  |  Chrome for Developers"
  href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/animate-to-height-auto"
/>

This was a long-needed feature and this is how I used it to create the final effect:

```html
<details>
  <summary>Summary</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>First list item</li>
    <li>Second list item</li>
    <li>Third list item</li>
  </ul>
</details>
```

```css
/* required for animating height:auto */
:root {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}

details::details-content {
  height: 0;
  opacity: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition:
    height 300ms,
    opacity 300ms,
    content-visibility 300ms allow-discrete;
}

details[open]::details-content {
  height: auto;
  opacity: 1;
  content-visibility: visible;
}
```

...and that's it! See it in action below:
