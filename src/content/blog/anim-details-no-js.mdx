While working on this site, I wound up using the HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` 
tags. They're quite neat if you're trying to go by with as little client-side JS 
as possible, but the only downside is that they don't support transitions out of 
the box, or atleast it seems complicated.

However, looking up the same online brought up some interesting results:  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/::details-content  
which demonstrates adding a smooth fade-in/out animations on the details content 
using the `::details-content` pseudo selector (baseline 2025). This was very neat 
and can be applied by simply following the guide they gave. It looked good but not 
quite what I was looking for, which was a height-based animation.

Opening up that pandora's box, I was reminded of the age-old problem of being unable 
to animate to keywords like `auto`. However, this time around I stumbled upon this 
excellent article:  
https://dev.to/francescovetere/css-trick-transition-from-height-0-to-auto-21de  
which has apparently been around for a while and I was just ignorant :D

But the technique discussed there by setting `display: grid` and animating the 
`grid-template-rows` didn't seem to work here (possible skill issue), but then I found
this article:  
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/animate-to-height-auto  
which addresses the exact problem of animating to `height: auto`! This was mind-blowing
and this is how I used it to create a *pretty looking accordion*:

```html
<details>
  <summary>Summary</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>First list item</li>
    <li>Second list item</li>
    <li>Third list item</li>
  </ul>
</details>
```

```css
/* required for animating height:auto */
:root {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}

details::details-content {
  height: 0;
  opacity: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition:
    height 300ms,
    opacity 300ms,
    content-visibility 300ms allow-discrete;
}

details[open]::details-content {
  height: auto;
  opacity: 1;
  content-visibility: visible;
}
```

...and that's it! See it in action below:
